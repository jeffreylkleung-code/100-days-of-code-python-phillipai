data types
- string: sequence of characters; String_var = "Hello World"
- integer: Whole numbers; Integer_var = 2
- float: Number with decimal point; Float_var = 2.2
- boolean: true or false; Boolean_var = true

Collections data type
These data types can contain a collection of elements or variables
data types is declared different with brackets, e.g. (), {}, []
- Set: unordered collection of unique elements; Set_var = {7, 2, 7}
- Dictionary: collection of key-value pairs; Dictionary_var = {'Hamburger': 5, 'fries': 2}
- Tuple: an immutable ordered colelction; Tuple_var = (7, 2, 7)
    - immutable: fixed, unchangeable value
- list: an ordered collection of elements that supports different data types; my_list = [1, 1.1, True, 'hello world']
- Range: sequence of numbers, often used in loops;
